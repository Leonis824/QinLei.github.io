I am Qin Lei, a recent graduate with distinction from the [Master of Science in Urban Design and Transport](https://www.arch.hku.hk/programmes/upad/master-of-science-in-urban-design-and-transport/) at the Department of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong. Prior to my master’s studies, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Traffic Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology. After that, I briefly served as a Project Engineer at China Construction Third Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd., where I participated in the Design Capital of Guangzhou (GDC) project.

Through my research, I developed strong skills in applying a wide range of computational approaches to urban and transportation problems. These include heuristic algorithms (e.g., Djikstra， A*) for efficient path planning, machine learning methods (e.g., XGBoost, ARIMA) for predictive analysis, deep learning architectures (e.g., GNNs, CNNs) for modeling spatial and network data, and reinforcement learning techniques (e.g., PPO) for adaptive decision-making. I am particularly interested in extending and combining these methods to tackle domain-specific challenges in transportation and urban design. These experiences have further deepened my academic curiosity and strengthened my interest in scholarly exploration. With this background, I am eager to advance my academic career and pursue doctoral research.

I am now working as a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Zhan Zhao](https://zhanzhaowf.github.io/)

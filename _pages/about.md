About
======
I am Qin Lei, a recent graduate with distinction from the [Master of Science in Urban Design and Transport](https://www.arch.hku.hk/programmes/upad/master-of-science-in-urban-design-and-transport/) at the Department of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong. Prior to my masterâ€™s studies, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Traffic Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology. After that, I briefly served as a Project Engineer at China Construction Third Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd., where I participated in the Design Capital of Guangzhou (GDC) project.

Through my research at HKU, I found great excitement in acquiring new methodologies and applying them effectively to urban and transportation problems. At the same time, I enjoy generating new ideas to address challenges that existing models cannot fully resolve. These experiences have further deepened my academic curiosity and strengthened my interest in scholarly exploration. With this background, I am eager to advance my academic career and pursue doctoral research.

I am now working as a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Zhan Zhao](https://zhanzhaowf.github.io/)
